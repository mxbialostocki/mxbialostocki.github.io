## mxbialostocki.github.io
a personal portfolio / CV site
built with Gatsby from the [gatsby-starter-default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

### story
I needed a new website that could demonstrate the creative content that my technical work entails. I wanted to show a couple of cool projects, but also run a rate card for my freelance photography with a few examples. I also needed the site to act as a CV and a visual connection to github and linkedIn.

## Quick start
You can play around with this structure by cloning down the repo and running first `npm install`, then `gatsby develop`.
The site will be served to `localhost:8000/`, and you can run GraphQL queries through `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`.
